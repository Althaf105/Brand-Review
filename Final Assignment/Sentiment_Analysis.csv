puma,"First of all I am a huge Puma fan. I have a narrow-ish foot, but not too narrow that I would wear an actual narrow width shoe. Puma running shoes tend to fit me better than most brands so I always go back to them. I have really enjoyed the Ignite cushioning the last few years and the Hybrid cushioning is a superb evolution to that.
The Pros: these are definitely a legit running shoe. They have the right amount of support and massive amounts of cushioning. And the all rubber sole on the entire mid-forefoot is a nice touch. I thought the copious amounts of rubber would affect the flexibility or balance of the shoe and I think if anything they complement it. The Hybrid cushioning is really the star here. The upper with the Netfit feels ventilated and supportive. I don’t think someone with a thick or wide foot would find these a good fit, but a n average to narrow foot would probably find these will fit perfect. The heel to toe transition is smooth and relaxed. The colors are attractive and the shoe simply looks good with gym clothes or athleisure.",Positive,0.246428571

puma,"I wasn't looking to actually purchase a new pair of shoes but when I discovered the price it was hard not to buy them! The color is absolutely awesome! The Nrgy Red is very bright and stands out love the color! The feel is absolutely awesome one of if not the best shoes I have ever owned! It is a hybrid type shoe which crosses Puma's ignite foam with the white nrgy beads give you an awesome bouncy support while this sounds strange but gives you a quicker forward momentum! And the Netfit gives you plenty of support not to tight, just enough to hug your foot which feels awesome! I highly recommend these shoes 100% satisfaction! I would be glad to answer any questions about them as well! Thank you and hope the review helps! Thank you for reading! Tyler F.",Positive,0.380948561

puma,"I love these. I'm a woman and usually wear about an 8 in women's. My feet are obviously expanding in my mid-30s. All my old athletic shoes were way too tight. So I was in the market for a new pair. I found some pretty women's shoes, but these really caught my eye. I bough the smallest size and they are super comfortable. I love the design and I'm completely happy with my purchase",Positive,0.232593795

,,,
puma,"HUGE flaws in the design of this product. I was happy to buy this product after seeing all the positive reviews but this shoe is just TOO narrow (see image). There's little to no breathing room in the top portion whereas the heel design leaves a little too much room such that it's easy for the heel to slip out when walking. This is the opposite of what I expected out of a casual sneaker since comfort is the main feature that you want out of one, except this is the opposite since the toe area is too tight and the heel area is too loose. That's not even the biggest issue. I don't know if this happened with other people's shoes but my right shoe came with the SOLE FOLDED IN HALF AND THE TOE PART OF THE SOLE GLUED UNDERNEATH THE REST OF THE SOLE (see image). I tried unfolding it but it just made it loose and now there is also a bump in the sole in the toe area, making the right shoe impossible to wear comfortably. Last of all, the package and shoe came a day LATE without warning and I was wondering why, but I realized it must be because the items were DAMAGED and repackaged during the initial delivery, according to the box (see image). I am super disappointed in this product, especially with all the other positive reviews (which could be fake bots). I already scheduled to return this item.",Neutral,0.006119662
,,,
puma,"Nice shoe. Seems to be quality leather.
As others have recommended, I’d also suggest going up a half size. I went back and forth, and ordered my typical size, and yes indeed, they were narrow. They fit like a soccer shoe. The length seemed typical and the leather is of a quality that suggests they will stretch and break in nicely, but I think the slim width would still leave a squeeze in the toe box. I exchanged for a half size larger and that worked, without having a fit that was too long. If your feet are of average width, that may also be the ticket for you, but if you have wider than average feet, this shoe is probably not for you.",Positive,0.055952381

,,,
puma,"My husband has had several pairs of these the past few years, all bought through Amazon. They fit well, and my husband stressed how comfortable they are. He hinted the other day that he’d like another pair in black. The nice thing about these is that they can carry over from work to casual day wear, even going with stuff when you want to dress it up a little. The price is decent too, and they don’t really go out of style. They do eventually wear out, though, but my husband wore them incessantly, from work to hanging out to holidays so for the price that’s to be expected over time and constant wear. ",Neutral,0.046875
,,,
puma,"I ordered my usual size but this pair gives my foot a strange feel. The heel and foot section fits well but is a bit tight across the toes. This is unlike my other Pumas that I wear regularly of the same size. Also, there is no extra room in the length like my other sneakers or athletic shoes that I own of same size. I could easily have ordered a half-size larger. Other than the tighter fit, I have no other complaint.",Neutral,-0.00702381

puma,"These Puma for like two clouds on my feet. I got the ones in black. They were as described by Puma. I am happy as a clam. I sold shoes for ten years at two big department stores, and I am very lucky. These pass the test. I am mentioning that, bc I saw a few negative negative reviews. I wear a 7, but one of my feet is a 6 1/2, so the 7 fits perfectly on me.",Positive,0.170833333

puma,"This is by far the most comfortable golf shoe I have ever worn. Fits perfectly, I take a size 11 and ordered a size 11. Update on my review, still the most comfortable golf shoe I have worn. The problem is they state these are made of waterproof mesh. The shoe is far from waterproof, actually it is not even water resistant. As the weather has cooled we get morning dew, my feet get soaked in this shoe. They are not waterproof whatsoever, misleading information.",Positive,0.333333333

,,,
puma,"These shoes are really comfortable, but the white base is not really white and the tag was old. There is no arch support for those who need it and the material can irritate soft skin.

Adidas,I'm new to running and didn't know anything about appropriate shoes. After a bit of Googling I came across Brooks. They have a 'which shoe is right for you' test on their website and these came up high for me. I had to re-adjust my pace when I started wearing them as I started running too fast for my level but these shoes give you the power to run short or long distances. I'm training for a 10k and would recommend these shoes. My normal shoesize isbetween 5 and 6. I see some say go for bigger size. I usually go for 5.5 in trainers and that's what I did here and they fit perfect.,Positive,0.211006494

,,,
Adidas,The shoe is a good running shoe. True to size fit. Maybe not for wider feet however still wider than ultraboost 1-4. The midfoot cage is more comfortable because it doesnt squeeze the 5th metatarsal bone the lateral side as much because of the new placement. The primeknit is only 3/4 of the shoe but lightly stiffer. The heel cup is made of a more padded soft material. There is no reflection on the orange heel line. The boost material is the same as the ultraboost 19. No carbonfiber plate. Outsole is the same as ultraboost 19.,Positive,0.355194805

,,,
Adidas,"y only downsides are that: (1) The shoes felt slightly clunky in my initial warm up kms (this shoe is quite heavy in comparison to others), but once my legs were warmed up, I didn't notice a thing, and the boost definitely helped to compensate the extra weight. (2) My feet warmed up pretty quickly in these shoes (and it wasn't due to weather, because it was a nice cool day in Toronto); I think a lot of it has to do with the upper cage, as I felt a bit of condensation after my run (not sure why the cage is there anyways – heats up the shoe and adds unnecessary weight imo)",Positive,0.124404762

I thought at first that they might soften but having walked my dog three times now wearing these shoes it's clear that I have to return these.

Nike,"These fit great. If you notice the negative reviews regarding width, they're men that purchased ""W"" shoes, which stands for ""Womens"". I have fat feet, and I ordered my normal sneaker size in mens shoes, and they fit great. I immediately put gel insoles in them, and they still didn't have quite enough cushion at first.
